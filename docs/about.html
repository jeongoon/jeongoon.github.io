   <!-- even though I setup @media to make change all the fixed font size;
        FF on mobile -- incorrectly -- scales font size again.
        This happends when:

        1. default font size variable (ex: 2vw, 3.5vw)
        2. the width of some division is larger than original width of website
           should be (or designed to be)
        3. now we have larger webstie width and mobile webbrowser scale down the
           website
        4. now we have too small size font
        5. FF scales up the font, which is irrelevant to the other normal divs.

     so I ended up re-insert below meta line again to correct them.

            <p>I am Myoungjin Jeon. I currently work as a chef in a Cafe. (owner chef).</p>
<p><em>I worked for a Japanese Chef for 12 years.
an am able to make nice sushi and sashimi as well. üòÅ</em></p>
<p>And also write some code. but I don‚Äôt have CS background
so some codes may be not efficient but even look awkward for who has CS degrees.</p>
<p>However, I hope I could help some open source project from time to time!</p>

<p>I have used <strong>linux</strong> + <strong>gnome</strong> since 2001</p>
<p>and enjoyed writing code in <strong>Perl</strong> since 2006 ish..
and _this site <a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/">https://theweeklychallenge.org/</a>
is best place for testing your language knowledge.</p>
<p>In mid of 2020, I saw many articles talked about a functional language.</p>
<p>and I studied basic <a href>Haskell</a> first and I was sold on the idiom of the language.</p>
<p>After learning <a href>Elm</a>,now I found that functional language was right choice!</p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to build something I could use in daily basis and this is
the place where I post something I learn and develop!</p>
<p>And last but not least,</p>
<p>I love to participate any environment related issues.</p>
<p>Nothing to show but I I am so mad about recycling as much as I can.</p>
<p>I just want to give what I enjoyed to my next generation people.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt want to be selfish.</p>
<p>Peace!</p>
