** Another Lisp family - Clojure

 Simply Speaking, Clojure is a modern lisp langauge working on JVM.
 There is a lot of explanation about this.

** Why Clojure?
  When learning a programming language, One major purpose would be using the language as manay as
  I could. It would be wonderful a programme langauge is running on Desktop, web, iOS, Android.. etc.

** REPL is always good idea on programming (IMHO)
