    Nice introduction to fish shell programming

** Recap fish variable Pros and Cons

** First Few functions

#+begin_quote
*WARNING:* A function is not an individual programme.
#+end_quote

 - It is part of your shell
   - if we are using =exit= in a function, it will actually shut down your current session.

 - we cannot control it as a process.
   this is not a child process, if we are using =sleep= in a function, it will actually sleep /your current session/.

#+begin_src sh
  fish> function sleep_10sec; sleep 10; end
  fish> sleep_10sec &
  ... paused ...
  ^C
  fish: Job 1, 'echo_e &' has ended
  fish> # note I canceled by pressing Ctrl-C on x86_64 linux
#+end_src

***  function command
****  -d option
**** functions directory for permanent access
**** still need to source

** function as aliasing
*** abbr
*** function

** elm function
***  what is elem
*** let's remind UNIX principle
*** where can I use?
