#+STARTUP: inlineimages

** I Kept writing in org-mode and..

 Not to forget how to write down in org-mode or literate haskell, I'm keeping my blog in /.lhs/
 or /.org/ and I realized that when I need to post in [[https://dev.to][/dev.to/]]. I found myself being a
 coverter. It is not very hard but annoying process. And I tried /pandoc/ as a commandline tool.

** Install pandoc
 you can install via =pacman= on arch linux!

 #+begin_src sh
   sh> sudo pacman -S pandoc                       2517ms î‚³ Mon 18 Apr 2022 21:54:37

 #+end_src

 Oh... Kay... abort mission. because I'm using /stack/ and /stack/ already has installed
 many haskell libraries already.

#+begin_src sh
  sh> stack install pandoc
  .. compiling ....
#+end_src

 TBH, if you are compiling for the first time, it would take a lot of time.
 +/ghc/ is not blazing fast software+. It is up to you, but if you don't use other haskell
 software, I recommends you try to install it via your package system first.

** Pandoc -t markdown

#+begin_src sh
  sh> pandoc -to markdown some-article.org > out.markdown
#+end_src

 and that's it.
 
** Fix metadata

 However, you might need to fix your metadata if you are input in your article.

 It looks like below:

 #+begin_export ascii
--- title: Builtin Benchmark with Go description: writing the benchmark
code in go langauge. keywords: go, golang, benchmark, org-mode, hakyll
author: Myoungjin Jeon ---
 #+end_export

 You can edit by yourself on your favourite editor or below /awk/ programme can take
 out the metadata part.

 save below as /hakyll-pandoc-preproc.awk/

#+begin_src awk
  #!/usr/bin/awk -f

  BEGIN {
      numof_printed = -1;
  }

  {
      if ( $0 ~ /^--*$/ ) {
          numof_printed++;
          if ( numof_printed > 0 ) {
              print $0;
              exit;
          }
      }

      if ( numof_printed >= 0 ) {
          print $0;
          numof_printed++;
      }
  }
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
  sh> chmod u+x hakyll-pandoc-preproc.awk
  sh> ./hakyll-pandoc-preproc.awk "your-document.org"

  Or.. maybe it is better for other script language to handle it.
