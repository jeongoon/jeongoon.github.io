Nice and Clean and its configuration is very straight foward for me.

I used to post some code on [dev.to](https://dev.to/) but sometimes, some
article isn't for everyone to share. So I needed my personal blogging platform.

My requirement is simple at the moment.

1. syntax highlighting for code.
2. markdown like syntax.
2. free web hosting.

and [hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll) serves more than I need now. ðŸ˜Ž


Most of time I code, I felt like something like below.

```haskell
data MentalStatus
  = IamGenius
  | IamDumb

```

ðŸ˜…

and also I'm wondering how css settings for Korean going.
í•œê¸€ í…ŒìŠ¤íŠ¸

That's all for testing blog now.
Cheers.
