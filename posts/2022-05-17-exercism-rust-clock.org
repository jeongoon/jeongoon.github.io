** Clock - Instructions from Exercism.org

#+begin_quote
Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

You will also need to implement .to_string() for the Clock struct.
We will be using this to display the Clock's state.
You can either do it via implementing it directly or using the Display trait.

Did you implement .to_string() for the Clock struct?

If so, try implementing the Display trait for Clock instead.

Traits allow for a common way to implement functionality for various types.

For additional learning, consider how you might implement String::from for the Clock type.
You don't have to actually implement thisâ€”it's redundant with Display,
which is generally the better choice when the destination type is String -- but
it's useful to have a few type-conversion traits in your toolkit.

** My first Iteration(implementation)

This is my first /working/ version. I didn't know that there is [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/?search=rem_euclid][=rem_euclid()=]] function, and
I made my own similar function first.
and I stored each property in a separate member variable, ~hours~ and ~minutes~, respectively.
Even though I could easily find that some other exercism user just stored in a single
variable. (~minutes only~).

#+begin_src rust
  use std::fmt;

  #[derive(PartialEq, Debug, Clone, Copy)]
  pub struct Clock {
      hours: i32,
      minutes: i32,
  }

  const MINUTES_PER_HOUR: i32 = 60;
  const HOURS_PER_DAY: i32 = 24;

  pub fn clock_div_mod (val: i32, by: i32) -> (i32, i32) {
      let ( mut quot, mut modu ) = ( val / by, val % by );

      if modu < 0 {
          modu += by;
          quot -= 1;
      }

      ( quot, modu )
  }
#+end_src


Basically, =clock_div_mod= will do wrapping down(floor) if the value is negative.

To display via =std::fmt::Display= trait, An implement for my Clock struct was required.

I think this structure -- hours and minutes are stored separately -- is good for
quick displaying because ~hours~ and ~minutes~ are not required to calculated everytime.

#+begin_src rust
  // https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello/print/print_display.html
  impl fmt::Display for Clock {
      fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
          write!(
              f,
              "{hours:0>2}:{minutes:0>2}",
              hours = &self.hours,
              minutes = &self.minutes
          )
      }
  }
#+end_src

={hours:0>2}= is working similar to below code in Perl (or c language)

#+begin_src perl
  printf( "%02d", 9 );
#+end_src

~Clock~ has a constructor and method for add minutes:

#+begin_src rust
  impl Clock {
      pub fn new(hours: i32, minutes: i32) -> Self {
          let mut clock = Clock {
              hours : hours,
              minutes : minutes,
          };

          // clean up the hours and minutes
          clock.add_minutes( 0 )
      }

      pub fn add_minutes(&mut self, minutes: i32) -> Self {
          let ( additional_hours, new_minutes ) =
              clock_div_mod( self.minutes + minutes, MINUTES_PER_HOUR );
          let ( _, new_hours ) =
              clock_div_mod( self.hours + additional_hours,
                             HOURS_PER_DAY );

          self.hours   = new_hours;
          self.minutes = new_minutes;
          *self
      }
  }
#+end_src

***  To Update or Not to Update
     But when I look someones' codes and realized that the person doesn't care about updating
     member values when calling =add_minutes=. They just create a new instance of Clock.
     Unfortunately, the test code on this task doesn't care about it is modified.
     but I'm wondering why we take ~&mut self~ if we don't need to update the values?

     I concluded that the spec doesn't say anything about update original instance so
     it is not required to implement. However, generally, it is safer to keep most of things
     immutable. (and this task didn't keep it even though mutability is not desired.)

***  implicit return without semi-colon(;)

    This is something that I am familiar with. In perl language, we can return a value as
    exactly same as we can in rust. (there are more ... ~raku~, ~ruby~ .. but not ~python~)

#+begin_src perl
  # this is a perl code not rust
  sub return_some_clock_as_hash {
      { 'hours' => 16,
        'minutes' => 53,
      }
  }
#+end_src

    You can define even a constant value in the same way in perl.

    In Rust, we cannot end the implicit statement with semicolon(;), On the contrary,
    we can even add a semi-colon in perl. (maybe in ruby as well?)
    as perl always return the last statement in a code block.

#+begin_src perl
  # perl code
  sub HOURS_PER_DAY { 24 }

  # or
  sub HOURS_PER_DAY { 24; }

  # both are working in Perl

#+end_src

  BTW, there is a module for defining constant for perl.

  credit: https://perldoc.perl.org/constant

#+begin_src perl
  # perl's first idiom:  There's more than one way to do it.
  # ??: but please don't give me too much.
  sub PI { 4 * atan2(1,1) }
  # or
  use constant PI => 4 * atan2(1,1)

#+end_src

  Nevetheless, it is quite convenient way to return a value and we can make sure that
  there is no more code logically after ~the code without semicolon~.

  So if I put more code after =*self=, the compiler will report an error regarding to
  your syntax.

#+begin_src rust
  // .. snip ..
          self.hours   = new_hours;
          self.minutes = new_minutes;
          *self; // note: semi-colon added
          // and there is no return type
  // .. snip ..
#+end_src

Will produce error message when compiling.

#+begin_src sh

** My Forth Iteration

#+begin_src rust
  use std::fmt;

  #[derive(PartialEq, Debug, Clone, Copy)]
  pub struct Clock {
      hours: u8,
      minutes: u8,
  }

#+end_src

And also I reduced the struct member size by using ~u8~ for each member variable ~hours~ and ~minutes~.

#+begin_src rust
  const MINUTES_PER_HOUR: i32 = 60;
  const HOURS_PER_DAY: i32 = 24;

  pub fn unsafe_clock_div_mod(val: i32, divider_: i32) -> (i32, i32) {
      // which doesn't check divider could be zero
      let divider = divider_ as i32;

      let (mut quot, mut modu) = (val / divider, val % divider);

      // below condition will not used in this implementation though ...
      if modu < 0 {
          modu += divider;
          quot -= 1;
      }
      (quot, modu)
  }

  // https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello/print/print_display.html
  impl fmt::Display for Clock {
      fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
          write!(
              f,
              "{hours:0>2}:{minutes:0>2}",
              hours = &self.hours,
              minutes = &self.minutes
          )
      }
  }
#+end_src

*** rem_euclid
    I realized that second call of =clock_div_mod= creats an unused value along with
    ~new_hours~ value. so I modified in my forth iteration. so I used =rem_euclid= for the case.

    And I add helper member function which is called =to_my_clock= for =new= and =add_minutes=.

#+begin_src rust
  impl Clock {
      fn to_my_clock(hours: i32, minutes: i32) -> Self {
          let total_minutes =
              (hours * MINUTES_PER_HOUR + minutes).rem_euclid(HOURS_PER_DAY * MINUTES_PER_HOUR);

          let (new_hours, new_minutes) = unsafe_clock_div_mod(total_minutes, MINUTES_PER_HOUR);

          Clock {
              hours: new_hours as u8,
              minutes: new_minutes as u8,
          }
      }

      pub fn new(hours: i32, minutes: i32) -> Self {
          Clock::to_my_clock(hours, minutes)
      }

      pub fn add_minutes(&mut self, minutes: i32) -> Self {
          let new_clock = Clock::to_my_clock(self.hours as i32, self.minutes as i32 + minutes);

          // update values
          *self = new_clock;
          *self
      }
  }
#+end_src

    I am still unsure I need to separate the values into ~hours~ and ~minutes~, but I guess
    it is depends on the situation. I could only guess that If we modify the value less
    and display more, it is better idea to separate them. Otherwise, we can keep in a
    single member variable.

** Wrapping Up

In this task, I realized that:

 - It is good idea to check out ~std~ method before I create one. (rem_euclid)
 - Implicit way of returning a value is similar to perl or raku.
   - it has simpler syntax
   - we could write them on purpose to detect redundant code after returning a value.

 - As instruction suggests, to implement ~std::fmt::Display~ is generally good idea
   for better integration with other formatting method.
 * return ~Self~ makes always create a copy of the original value, which seems to
   good idea in general programming which make less side effects.

** Thank you

  Thank you for reading !!
  I am still very confused with Rust language, but it seems worth learning!!
