---
I am Myoungjin Jeon. I currently work as a chef in a Cafe. (owner chef).

*I worked for a Japanese Chef for 12 years.
an am able to make nice sushi and sashimi as well. üòÅ*

And also write some code. but I don't have CS background
so some codes may be not efficient but even look awkward for who has CS degrees.

However, I hope I could help some open source project from time to time!

I have used **linux** + **gnome** since 2001

and enjoyed writing code in **Perl** since 2006 ish..
and _this site https://theweeklychallenge.org/
is best place for testing your language knowledge.

In mid of 2020, I saw many articles talked about a functional language.

and I studied basic Haskell_ first and I was sold on the idiom of the language.

After learning Elm_,now I found that functional language was right choice!

.. _Haskell https://www.haskell.org
.. _Elm https://elm-lang.org

I'd like to build something I could use in daily basis and this is
the place where I post something I learn and develop!

And last but not least,

I love to participate any environment related issues.

Nothing to show but I I am so mad about recycling as much as I can.

I just want to give what I enjoyed to my next generation people.

Don't want to be selfish.

Peace!
